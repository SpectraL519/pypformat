# PyPformat - TODO

## Planned features

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) support
- Support for `dataclass` formatting
- Direct `print` function(s)
- A `pack_items: bool` formatting option - if enabled, the formatter should pack as many item of iterables and mappings into a single line, as possible within the limit defined by the `width` option
